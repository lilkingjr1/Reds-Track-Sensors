[h1]Description:[/h1]
Red's Track Sensors is a custom SCO package of various proximity sensors and track mounting hardware to dress up your ride with a fully functional sensor system. There are currently 5 different styles of sensor, all modeled after Pepperl+Fuсhs' iconic sensors used on most modern real coasters. Each sensor is fully recolorable, and has functional indicator LEDs that will illuminate when a train passes over, all automatically - without any manual track triggers. The pack also comes with a handful of recolorable mounting hardware for most coaster types. This hardware can be manually placed, or easily snapped to the closest track for perfect alignment. Multiple sensors can then be easily snapped to any position, on any mount, simply by putting them in proximity of a mount. All items are designed to be "one size fits all", with multiple configuration options to position them, and their mounts, in any orientation you would like.
